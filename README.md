### [ STATUS: SYSTEM_OPERATIONAL ]

Welcome to the **Culinary Randomizer** module of the Maximum Reality Universe. This application is a Michelin-star randomizer designed by **Mochkil** (the tuxedo kitten/Chef) and optimized for mobile-first deployment.

## 📡 Overview
The Snack OS serves as a high-speed portal to the **Maximum Reality Recipe Vault**. Instead of manual database navigation (the "scavenger hunt"), this OS allows users to scan the simulation and generate a specific culinary mission.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Architecture:** HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
- **Environment:** Optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max / Mobile Safari
- **Visuals:** Cyberpunk-Neon / Terminal UI

## 🧪 System Features
* **Boot Sequence:** Simulated OS initialization with real-time progress bar.
* **The Randomizer:** JavaScript-driven logic that discovery-samples from the `recipeLibrary` data matrix.
* **Dynamic Linking:** Seamless redirection to the main Recipe Vault based on generated results.
* **Terminal Aesthetics:** High-contrast #00ff41 (Matrix Green) and #ff00ff (Neon Pink) interface.
